# HTMl elements already has predefined rules to display it in webpage
->Rules on how elements get render on the screen
1.Content is everything
2.Order comes from code
3.Children sit on parents->z-axis defines which element will be displayed on the other one
    e.g parent:<div>
            children:<h1> a programmer</h1>
            </div>

# Position
-> positon elements on the screen in the way that we want to instead of default layout
-> 4 positioning types:

1. Static Position
-> go along with the html rules and keep to the default html flow

2. Relative Position
-> poition the element that we select relative to how it would have been positioned had it been static
-> is relative to where the element would have been diaplayed if it was just following the natural html flow
-> coordinates:top,bottom,left,right must be set for it to work like {position:relative; top:20px;}
-> when element having relative positioning is moved it doesn't affect the position of other elements on the screen

3. Absolute Position
-> position the element relative to its parent
->  eg div{position:relative;}
        img{
            position:absolute;
            right:30px;
        }
    Here parent is div and the 30px right margin is added between the image and div element
-> affects the flow of the html
-> the parent must have display set to relative inorder for the element to have absolute positioining relative to that parent 
   else it will position relative to body

4. Fixed Position
-> element stays in its current position no matter of the scroll
-> e.g {position:fixed; 
        top:0}
-> useful for navbar/sidbar that is to be stayed fixed so that it follows the user as they scroll through the website

# Float property:
-> helps to wrap the text around certain element
-> don't use it for positioining instead use relative or absolute positioning or using margin and padding
-> eg. {float: left;}

# Clear property:
-> prevents element from wrapping anything in specified direction
-> eg.{clear:left;}
    makes sure that the left margin is cleared and not wrapped around anything
