# Introduction:
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets


# Inline CSS
<body style="background-color: blue;">


# Internal CSS
below title section in head element add following
    <style>
            body{
                background-color: #7B66FF;
            }
    </style>


# External CSS
add a link external link to the css file as:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">


# Priority order 
    inline > internal > external


# Anatomy of css syntax
-> syntax: selector{property:value;}
-> defined as: who?{what?:how?;}
-> eg: h1{color:red;}
-> best practise is to have properties in alphabetical order


# Comments in css
/* this is comment */


# id vs classes
-> use id to apply a specifc style to a single element on the webpage
-> use classes when you want to apply same style to the group of related items
-> cant have more than one id for a particular element


# Pseudoclass
-> keywords have colon(:) infront
-> html elements can have different states
-> make changes to the elements based on its state
-> eg: hover Pseudoclass
    image:hover {
        background-color:gold;
    }
