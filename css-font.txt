# Font-family
-> among 6 types only 3 types are used:

1.Monospace:
-> each of the character inside the text take same amount of width
-> mostly used for writing code
-> makes everything super easy to read

2.Serif and 3.Sans-Serif:
-> for normal website styling
-> serif is by default font styling method
-> for most browser default serif is times font and default sans-serif is arial font
-> to change the default sans-serif from arial to verdana use:
    {font-family: verdana, sans-serif}

3.Cursive and Fantasy:
-> generally not used
-> has low readability
-> don't look that great

# Font-size:
-> to make dynamic fonts change the font-size to % rather than px
-> 100% equals to 16px size
-> another way to make dynamic font is by using "em"
-> 1em is 16px
-> 16px = 100% = 1em

*NOTE: font-size if dynamic gets inherited and added on top of whatever it got from its parent

-> "rem"-root em is used to ignore all of the parent setting for the font-size
-> rem is most recommended as it is the most adoptable,reliable and least error-prone
