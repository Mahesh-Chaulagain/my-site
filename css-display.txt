# Display:

-> 6 different values

1.Block
-> takes up whole width of the screen
-> block everything from being on the same line with themselves
-> common block elements: <p>,<headers h1..h6>,<div>,<ol>,<ul>,<li>,<form> 

2.Inline
-> takes up only as much space as it needs to
-> commom inline elements: <span>,<img>,<a>
-> with inline elements width can't be changed

3.Inline-Block
-> can change width and height
-> the elemnts can be added in the same line next to each other

4.None
-> get rid of element
-> display:none hides the element from the web page
-> visibility:hidden makes the element disapper but it keeps its original position and all other elements flow around it

5.Flex
-> parent with display set to flex will have children in a single line
-> set flex-direction to either row or column to change flex layout
-> use justify-content to align items horizontally when direction in row and vertically when direction in column
-> use align-items to align items vertically when direction in column and horizontally when direction in row

6.Grid
-> works two dimensionally
-> to create three columns use-
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; or repeat(3,1fr)
   to create rows use grid-template-rows
-> allows to easily take any element and move it anywhere in that grid
