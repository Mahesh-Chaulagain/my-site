# To center the element
-> add the following to the parent element
    body{
        text-align:center;
    }
    This will center everything inside that doesn't have the width set
    
-> another way is by using margin
    h1{
        margin:0 auto 0 auto;   # center horizontally(TRBL)
    }
    If the width is set use the margin method
